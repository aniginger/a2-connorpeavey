## GPA Calculator

The application is a basic GPA calculator, where the user can input classes, the grade they recieved, and how many credits the class was worth, and are then given their GPA, rounded to the nearest hundreths place. A CSS grid was used for the table layout.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single page app where the user can add and delete data from the table, with the app calculating based on that information.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The user can adjust the most recent entry to account for mistakes without having to delete the entire entry.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Used color palette**: Utilized all colors in a palette from color.adobe.com. A screenshot of the palette is in the img directory.
- **Used fonts from Google Fonts**: The site uses the Autowide and Fugaz fonts from Google Fonts.
- **Evaluation**:
    1. Alqassar
    2. Found a bug with the adjust button when being used more than once with the button deleting too many rows
    3. They making the rows a shared class to make them easier to navigate.
    4. I kept the interface the same, as they felt it was easy to understand, but fixed up the issues they found.

    1. Ni
    2. Suggested better error checking as there are a few ways to break the program when there are no table entries or if the user enters incorrect data.
    3. They suggested restricting some values the user can enter, which I went on to incorporate.
    4. I emplyed extra checks, such as not being able to delete the title row if there are now rows currently and restricting the credit input to numeric values..
